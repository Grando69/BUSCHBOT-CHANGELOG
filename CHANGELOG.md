## QUICK INFORMATION

### Why am I starting on V.3.0?

This is the first official Changelog for BUSCHBOT. The first version was just a test. Second version was me being serious and using a premade command-handler. Now I made my own, switched to DISCORDJS V13 and im using TS which I am completly new to.
